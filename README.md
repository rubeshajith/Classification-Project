Mobile Price Range Prediction

Abstract:

Different feature selection algorithms are used to identify and remove less important and redundant features and have minimum computational complexity. Different classifiers are used to achieve as higher accuracy as possible. Results are compared in terms of highest accuracy achieved and minimum features selected. Conclusion is made on the base of best feature selection algorithm and best classifier for the given dataset. This work can be used in any type of marketing and business to find optimal product (with minimum cost and maximum features). Future work is suggested to extend this research and find more sophisticated solution to the given problem and more accurate tool for price estimation.

Problem Statement:

In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices.

The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (e.g.: - RAM,Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

• Battery_power - Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh

• Blue - Has bluetooth or not

• Clock_speed - speed at which microprocessor executes instructions

• Dual_sim - Has dual sim support or not

• Fc - Front Camera mega pixels

• Four_g - Has 4G or not

• Int_memory - Internal Memory in Gigabytes

• M_dep - Mobile Depth in cm

• Mobile_wt - Weight of mobile phone

• N_cores - Number of cores of processor

• Pc - Primary Camera mega pixels

• Px_height - Pixel Resolution Height

• Px_width - Pixel Resolution Width

• Ram - Random Access Memory in Mega Bytes

• Sc_h - Screen Height of mobile in cm

• Sc_w - Screen Width of mobile in cm

• Talk_time - longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are

• Three_g - Has 3G or not

• Touch_screen - Has touch screen or not

• Wifi - Has wifi or not

• Price_range - This is the target variable with value of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).
